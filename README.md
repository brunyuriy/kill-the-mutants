# kill-the-mutants

[Kill the Mutants](TODO) is an educational tool that teaches developers how to write better fault-detecting test suites. As you progress through Kill the Mutants, your progress is saved to this repository.

## Structure

Our goal is to make each example simple to follow. Each example has its own folder with the following files:

##### Snippet.java
This file is a small class (or 'snippet') that contains the code to be tested.

##### TestSuite.java
This file is how you run your tests. It should be the same in every example folder.

If you have written a test suite for an example, you will also see any number of subfolders with timestamp names. Each of these have the following file:

##### Tests.java
This file contains your test suite!

## Running a Test Suite

To run any of your test suites, you need to install Docker to your machine. Follow instructions to install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

*Mac and Windows Users:*  
If you are using Mac OS X or Windows, make sure to run the Docker Quickstart Terminal. Your docker machine must have more than 500MB of memory as the JVM we run uses 500MB. We found that 1GB of memory and 2 processors worked best.

All that's left is to build and run your container. Make sure you define the following environment variables:

```
Required:

USERNAME    Your Github username
TESTNAME    The example name you would like to run
TIMESTAMP   The timestamp of the test suite you want to run

Optional:

TEST_TOOL   The command you want to execute on your code
  junit   :  Vanilla JUnit testing (default)
  pit     :  PIT mutation testing tool
  jumble  :  Jumble mutation testing tool

// Example environment variable usage:
$ docker run container_name --env VAR=value
```

Here are some common commands to help you along:

```
// Build your current directory into an image
$ docker build --tag=kill-the-mutants .

// Run a new docker container using an image
$ docker run --env USERNAME=kill-the-mutants --env TESTNAME=example1 --env TIMESTAMP=0000000000 --env TEST_TOOL=pit kill-the-mutants

// Run an existing docker container and then open it (~ ssh)
$ docker run -t -i kill-the-mutants bash

// List all containers
$ docker ps

// Stop a running container
$ docker stop kill-the-mutants

// Remove a container
$ docker rm kill-the-mutants
```

##### Troubleshooting

###### "Help! My docker container hangs!"

This is a problem that we used to run into before we increased the memory of the JVM in the docker container. Our original idea was to increase the docker machine's memory, which while it helped, did not solve the actual problem. We wanted to keep these commands here for future reference. Note that these are only relevant on Mac OS X or Windows, as docker simply runs on your machine by itself if you are running Linux.

```
docker-machine rm default
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 4096 --virtualbox-cpu-count 2 default
```

You can check your docker-machine's settings here if you are a mac user:

```
~/.docker/machine/machines/default/config.json
```

###### "Help! My docker container can't connect to the internet!"

If you docker machine is open when you switch internet connections, it may lose it's connection with the outside world. All you have to do is restart your docker-machine and it will take care of itself.

```
docker-machine restart default
```
